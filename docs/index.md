!!! info "Contributing to Documentation"
    Great software is coupled with even greater documentation. If you would like to contribute to making this documentation even better, please don't hesitate to fork the [documentation repository](https://github.com/eveseat/docs) and submit a pull request with your contribution. We are always looking for better information.

## Quick Start

There are many ways to install SeAT. In all cases you will need a dedicated Linux server as a minimum (except for Docker). Using the docker installation you are free to choose *any* Docker capable host (yes, even Windows!). However, if you choose to install SeAT in a VM, we suggest you choose an LTS version of Ubuntu, Debian or CentOS.

### Installation Options

Ignoring the details, to get SeAT installed quickly you have a few options. All of them will get you SeAT installed, but you still have to manually configure an SSO application on the EVE Online Developers portal.

| Method | Comments |
| ------------ |  ------------ |
| Docker | `bash <(curl -fsSL https://git.io/seat-docker)` <br> This will download and run a [helper script](https://github.com/eveseat/scripts/blob/master/docker-compose/bootstrap.sh) that will ensure `docker` and `docker-compose` is available and start SeAT in containers. |
| SeAT Tool | `bash <(curl -fsSL https://git.io/seat-installer)` <br> This will download and run a [helper script](https://github.com/eveseat/scripts/blob/master/install/installer.sh) to start the installation process. Once done, the SeAT Tool will be available to use and provide semi automated installation option for _Debian 8 / 9_, _Ubuntu LTS versions_ and _CentOS 7_. |
| Manually | You can always install SeAT using one of the detailed manual guides available. All you need is PHP, MariaDB, Redis and a web server and some Linux experience. Refer to the [manual guides](/installation/manual/getting_started/) for more information. |

Best way to start your SeAT installation would be [Basic Installation](/installation/basic_installation/). However, if you know what you are doing or need more options, head over to [Advanced Installation](/installation/manual/getting_started/)
